            "SUMMARY": "Ada is a curious little girl who observes the world quietly and does not speak until she turns three. Her parents are patient, waiting to see what she will say.",
            "REASONING": "These opening pages introduce Ada, set up her quiet curiosity, and show the patience and care of her parents. The event centers on Ada's early years, her silence, and the anticipation surrounding her first words. It's a unified introduction to the main character and her family."

            "END": 5,
            "SUMMARY": "Ada starts to speak and asks many questions, starting with 'Why?' Her parents encourage her curiosity as she tries to understand everything she sees.",

            "SUMMARY": "Ada grows up, continues to be curious and even causes chaos at home and school, but everyone recognizes her as a budding scientist.",
            "REASONING": "Here, the story moves forward in time. Ada's curiosity grows with her, and this segment highlights her school experiences and her scientific nature. It's a new setting (school) and escalation of her curiosity."

            "SUMMARY": "Ada's experiments cause trouble at home, and her parents get frustrated. Ada is told to sit and think by herself, feeling sad and unsure.",
            "REASONING": "There is a clear emotional and event transition as Ada's curiosity results in a mess and her parents' reaction changes. The focus here is Ada's setback, her feelings, and her time spent alone."

            "SUMMARY": "Ada continues to ask questions and think, filling the hallway with her ideas. Her parents calm down and realize that Ada is simply very curious, and they decide to support her.",
            "REASONING": "This segment is about Ada's resilience and her family's turn from frustration to understanding and support. It deals with resolution of conflict and reestablishes family unity."
