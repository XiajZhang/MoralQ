            "SUMMARY": "Rob gets ready for his day as a firefighter, packs his things, says goodbye to his family, and arrives at the fire station.",
            "REASONING": "This segment covers the introduction to Rob and the beginning of his day, up to when he starts his shift at the fire station. It establishes the setting and the main character's role."
