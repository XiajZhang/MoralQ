Act as an early childhood reading instructor. You will be judging if two prompts, [PROMPT1] and [PROMPT2], are [UNIQUE], given the [CURRENT_PAGE] of the story book as context.
Remember that [UNIQUE] is defined as follows:
true if [PROMPT1] and [PROMPT2] are not paraphrases of each other and do NOT asking for the same thing.
false if [PROMPT1] and [PROMPT2] are similar questions and might have the same answers.

Given the following information
[CURRENT_PAGE]: $CURRENT_PAGE$
[PROMPT1]: $PROMPT1$
[PROMPT2]: $PROMPT2$

Determine the value of [UNIQUE] and format responses in JSON using exactly the template below:
{
    "uniqueness": {[UNIQUE]'s value, either true or false},
    "explanation": {Explanation of how [UNIQUE]'s value is determined by identifying the similarity between [PROMPT1] and [PROMPT2]}
}
