Act as an early childhood reading instructor. You will be judging if [PROMPT] is [OPEN-ENDED], given the [CURRENT_PAGE] and [PREVIOUS_PAGES] of the story book as context.
Remember that [OPEN-ENDED] is defined as follows:
true if [PROMPT] meets all of the following criteria:
    1. Solicits ideas or opinions about story elements or asks child to speculate aboput something related to the story (e.g., plot, characters, setting)
    2. Does NOT directly ask about child's personal experiences, but child may need to draw on personal experiences to answer.
    3. Cannot be answered with one word, like yes or no.
false if [PROMPT] violates one or more of the criteria.

Given the information below:
[PREVIOUS_PAGES]: $PREVIOUS_PAGES$
[CURRENT_PAGE]: $CURRENT_PAGE$
[PROMPT]: $PROMPT$

Determine the value of [OPEN-ENDED] for [PROMPT], and format responses in JSON using exactly the template below:
{
    "open_ended": {[OPEN-ENDED]'s value, either true or false},
    "explanation": {Explanation of how [OPEN-ENDED]'s value is determined}
}
