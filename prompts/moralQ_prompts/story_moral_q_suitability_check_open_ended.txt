    1. Solicits ideas or opinions about story elements or asks child to speculate aboput something related to the story (e.g., plot, characters, setting)
    2. Solicits reflection or inferential thinking of the progression of the story, and build-up to the child's understanding of the overall [MORAL_OF_STORY].
    3. Does NOT directly ask about child's personal experiences, but child may need to draw on personal experiences to answer.
    4. Does NOT include more than one question. If a [PROMPT] ask two or more questions, it does not qualify.
    5. Cannot be answered with one word, like yes or no.

False if [PROMPT] violates one or more of the criteria.
